# Vpnget

vpnget is a small program meant to download openvpn configuration files from vpngate's api and save them as files in the current working directory. It performs some sanitization of the encoded config files to reduce the risk of the config executing malicious commands.

At this time, vpnget does its small job and no other functionality is planned.

If you have the means, please host your own openvpn server and post it to [vpngate.net](https://vpngate.net/en/).
